        <h3>The Craft of Writing</h3>
            <p>Writing makes you think - what do you want to communicate, what
            point are you trying to make, who are you communicating with? The
            act of writing hones mastery, and we believe in communicating information
            that is clear, concise and readable. We provide all of our articles
            and papers for free, and we aim to provide a distraction-free environment
            to learn. While there is an abundance of information in textbooks,
            on the internet and in scientific journals, it can be overwhelming to
            read complex, complicated documents that are more about the writer's
            ego than the reader, or navigate websites that are covered with ads
            and distracting gimmicks. We hope you find our articles fun and easy to
            read, but most importantly, enlightening.</p>

            <p>There is relatively broad range of topics in the articles below,
            ranging from business analysis to international relations to academic
            computer science papers, but all have a common theme; using analytical
            thinking to understand and improve the world around us. Feel free to
            read any of the papers, ask questions and let us know if you have any
            comments or suggestions.</p>

        <h4>R Programming</h4>
            <p>'R' is a statistical programming language used by many (if
              not most) data scientists. Learning to interact with 'R' is an
              essential skill for data science, although if you have never
              programmed before, the learning curve can be steep. All of these
              articles treat learning 'R' in a fun and approachable way.</p>

        <h4>Statistics</h4>
            <p>Statistics is the mathematial foundation for data science - it underlies
                the entire process, from data collection to accuracy assessment
                data visualization.  These papers approach statistics in an applicable
                way, focusing on how statistical methodology can be applied to
                real-world problems in helpful ways.</p>

        <h4>Prediction Modeling and Machine Learning</h4>
            <p>You're probably heard the buzz around these terms - with the computational
            power available today, anyone has the ability to quickly and effectively
            use statistics and machine learning principles to predict and better
            understand the information that is available. We approach this subject
            with an enthusiasm of the potential to put them to good use, but they
            are not magic, and they can only be used effectively on a strong foundation.
            These papers seek to provide strong insight into the process of building
            these models, while avoiding sensationalism and over-promises.</p>

        <h4>International Affairs and History</h4>
            <p>We're passionate about using the tools at our disposal to improve
            the global environment. After several years working on complex, cross-cultural
            issues in the military, we've found that the same type of analytical
            thinking in data and computer science can be applied to international
            affairs, which along with the discipline of history, has traditionally
            been driven by instinct and cherry-picked information. We approach the
            subject by finding accurate data and sound reasoning to improve
            decision-making within global affairs. </p>
